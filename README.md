# Abaqus-CAE-UMAT-subroutine-for-3D-Composite-fatigue-simulation
In this project, we modeled the fatigue behavior of a composite material in 3D space using the UMAT subroutine in Abaqus. The Abaqus .inp file and part of the UMAT subroutine are provided. To access the video tutorial and all the modeling files for this project, click the link below.
